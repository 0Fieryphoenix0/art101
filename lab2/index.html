					<h3>Paragraph about Lia</h3>
					<div id="paragraph">
						<p>
							Hello, I am Lia. I am a digital artist and game designer. I know next to nothing about the
							industry and frankly don't play as many games as the average games major but I sure do play
							Genshin Impact obsessively. I don't have very ambitious goals in the games industry; I'd
							just like to make fun little games or be able to contribute artistically to bigger, more
							complex games. My brain is a bit silly goofy and has trouble understanding code and doesn't
							know how to ask for help.
						</p>
						<br>
						<h3>Paragraph about Lily</h3>
						<p>
							Hi! I am Lily. I am also a digital artist, but I am not a game designer. I somehow decided
							to choose Econ as my major, and I greatly regret(not going to give up on Econ though). I
							play a lot of video games, and what I care about the most in a game is it's art style and
							plot. That is also what I care about in my own works. I try to make my artworks and
							fanfiction look good and stay true to the lore. I have a carrd too if you want to learn more
							about me.
