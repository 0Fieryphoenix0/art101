			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>The subject of this lab is to learn how to develop pseudocode for tasks. We tried to create
					pseudocode for a rock paper scissors game.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Difficulties Encountered</h2>
				<p>An dificulty for me is completing the assignment on time. I am currently preping for midterms and
					doing other works, and keeping track of things are problematic. Other than that, there is no
					real issues.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>This is the pseudocode for replacing a SIM card from a smartphone, placed in a
					&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; code block.</p>
				<div class="minor-section">
					<pre><code>
	Remove any protective cases your phone may have, if any.
	Obtain a specialized tool for SIM card removal; 
		a small paper clip will suffice as well, but if this option is chosen, 
		the person doing the removal needs to unbend the paper clip and straighten the point long enough to fit into the hole.
	Place the tip of the paper clip or tool into the hole and press with not too much force, but just enough to apply some amount of pressure.
	If done correctly, the SIM card slot will dislodge out of its slot, enabling access to the SIM card.
	Replace the SIM card with the new one of your choice.
	When replacement is complete, slide the slot back into place and the latch will engage again, rendering the SIM card operational for use.
							</pre></code>
				</div>
				<p>This is the pseudocode for RPS (rock paper scissors), placed in a &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; code
					block.</p>
				<div class="minor-section">
					<pre><code>
	Ask the user for input confirming their selection
	When a valid input is received, the computer randomly chooses one of the three options of RPS
	The computer displays which outputs have been chosen by both participants and then declares the result of the game based on what inputs have been provided.
		If both inputs are the same, the game declares a tie.
		Else, the computer displays which person has won based on whose input beats the other’s input.
	After completion of the above steps, the game asks the user if they wish to play once more.
							</pre></code>
				</div>
				<p>This is the pseudocode for RPS (rock paper scissors), commented as if it were in a JavaScript
					file.</p>
				<div class="minor-section">
