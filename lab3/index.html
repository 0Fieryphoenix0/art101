			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challange of this lab is to correctly find and edit the contents in diffrent folders, and direct them to the right index.html file. This lab also tests our understanding on previous knoladges learned from this course, including css, html, and file structures.</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I have had challanges reconizing which is the right img folder to upload images to, and also creating a hyperlinked text also took some time. My teammate helped me out on solving both issues. I realized I have to put the images in the img folder that is outside of the labs for the homepage image to work out. I also figured out how to make text hyperlinked by putting text inside the "a href".</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment is slightly challanging and enhaces my knoladge on CSS and HTML. I started this lab a bit nervous because it is the first lab that is due in two days. I also have to work with a new partner. After completeing the lab, I feel like I am now confident in my HTML skills and would like to try more challanging projects in the future.</p>
